<h3>This is my first package ever.</h3> 

<h3>This algorithm solves classfication using OvR rule.</h3>

<p>
Problems encountered - 1.  I was getting only accuracy of 33% while testing.
                           Further inspection showed that it was because I was not standardizing 
                           the test data. After I made provision for standardizing test data, my accuracy
                           now is at 100% for the wine dataset
